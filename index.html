Many many happy returns of the day! 🥰[ Copied from google as I'm Idiot 😛 ]
You age is going up and will never come down so I pray that one day you will be a good grandma 😛 ( I'm not kidding. 🙂)
Life isn't long so use your time, make youself better, make you family proud and love them! 😊 
That's it from me, BTW don't forget to iron your dress before the Birthday Party! 😉</p>
